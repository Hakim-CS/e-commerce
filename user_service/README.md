## Setup & Run Instructions

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build user_service

# Or for the entire application
docker-compose up --build
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/user_service
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=supersecretkey
export SESSION_SECRET=sessionsecretsuperkey
export FLASK_APP=main.py

# Run database migrations
flask db upgrade

# Run the application
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
# Or with gunicorn (production)
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 2 main:app
```

## Default Admin Credentials

Username: `admin`  
Password: `admin123`

The admin user has full access to all aspects of the application and is created automatically when the application first runs.

## Database Schema

The service uses the following main models:
- User: Stores user information and credentials
- Role: Defines user roles (admin, user)
- Permission: Defines granular permissions
- Address: Stores user addresses
- Contact: Stores user contact information
- Token: Manages JWT token tracking

## Development

To run migrations when models change:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"
flask db upgrade
```
